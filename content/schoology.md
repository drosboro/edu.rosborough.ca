+++

I have taken a look at [Schoology](http://www.schoology.com) in the past, but have generally stuck with [EdModo](http://www.edmodo.com) for my classroom LMS.  For the upcoming year, however, I will be trying Schoology for one big reason: _audio recording in the iOS / Android app_.

Overall, the iOS app from Schoology is more mature than the comparable EdModo one.  It seems to be well connected and allows the user access to photos, videos, etc when submitting assignments.  For me, however, the big feature is being able to do a quick audio recording _right in the app_.  As a choir teacher, this means I can construct simple singing exercises, and the student needs nothing more than their phone or tablet and the Schoology app to complete the assignment.  This simplifies the workflow for students significantly, which is great.

The only downside is that the student cannot see the assignment information while they are making their recording.  This is a minor downside for my situation (where the student will likely be working from printed music for the assignments anyways), but could be a bigger issue for, say, language teachers wanting students to read a passage.
